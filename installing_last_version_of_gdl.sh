# Scope and description of the script
######################################
# This script has the intention of helping you to compile and install
# GDL and some of its dependencies on a computer running GNU/Linux
# where:
#
#  * You don't have super-user access.
#  * You have a space's quota, so no free MB for compiling all.
#
# Also, it has the aim (maybe not yet) of helping you to understand
# which is the utility of GDL dependencies, empowering you to 
# understand what you need and you don't. Personally, I found very
# difficult to have a working installation of GDL from source.
#
# The original scope of this script was to install GDL in any
# user's account of the aula Paolo Poropat at University of Trieste,
# Italy. GDL 0.9 should be installed yet on those computers, but there
# are reasons for using the development version (or the lastest
# stable one), since GDL is in a soon state and new compatibility
# features are added continuosly.
#
# If you are installing GDL on any other environment, this script
# still can be useful. However, you probably have to download other
# dependencies and make several changes on the script, but it is
# work done and it can save you time.
#
# This script is useful for those users which HASN'T SUPER-USER ACCESS
# to the OS. If you have it, you could simply install the *-dev
# versions of the dependencies and avoid to compile them.
#
# FIXME:
# If you don't have other reason for compiling GDL that the fact of
# having a working version, you
# haven't to do it. Just only run the install_gdl_0.9.1.sh script
# (but read the instructions on it before) which will copy to
# your account the software compiled using this method.
